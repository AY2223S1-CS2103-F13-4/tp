### Project: HealthCare Xpress

HealthCare Xpress is a desktop application that is to be used by medical administrator for managing patients that require home-visits and nurses. It helps medical administrators manage nurses, patients, their next of kin and attending physicians.The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has 10042 lines of code.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Features**:

  1.  Uid & Uid Manager

  - What it does:
    - Unique Id and the manager to manage operations associated with the uid.
  - Justification:
    - Uid and Uid Manager solves the issue whereby the medical administrator may enter very similar persons into Healthcare Xpress.
    - Uid helps to differentiate between these individuals.
  - Highlights:
    - Implementing a unique set of uid was challenging.

  2. Delete Command

  - What it does:
    - Deletes the person based on their uid.
  - Justification:
    - The delete command is an essential command so that the medical administrator can remove persons who are no longer relevant.

  3. Check Similar Command

  - What it does:
    - Deletes the person based on their uid.
  - Justification:
    - The delete command is an essential command so that the medical administrator can remove persons who are no longer relevant.
